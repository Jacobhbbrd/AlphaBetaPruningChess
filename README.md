# AlphaBetaPruningChess

A simple command line chess game that supports human and/or computer players. 
Two humans can play, two computers can play or one of each can play.
Computer players will check a user set amount of possible moves ahead
before making their next move using an alpha-beta pruning algorithm.

## Install

Just grab the ChessState.java file and use javac to compile
```
javac ChessState.java
```
If you don't have the JDK installed you can get it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

## Input
Input format
```
java ChessState <player 1 depth check value> <player 2 depth check value>
```
The program takes two numbers as command line arguments.
Each number represents the depth that will be checked to determine the next move for a player.
A command line argument of 0 means the player will be a human player.
Any number greater than 0 means the player will be a computer player.
If both players are computer players, the computer player that checks the most moves ahead should
usually win. For example, the command line arguments "0 5" means Player One will be a human player and
Player Two will be a computer player that checks 5 moves ahead before determining
the best move to take next.
Making both numbers the same may result in a never ending game as both
computer players will sometimes repeat moves over and over so that neither player loses.
The never ending game issue may occassional happen even when the numbers are different.
This happens because this program does not account for all of the formal rules of chess.
Increasing the number of moves checked will make move calculations take longer. Checking 8 or more 
moves ahead for each move will take a considerable amount of time per move early in the game because
of all the possible ways for the game to play out. If you think about it as a tree, each move is a branch
and each node is a possible state of the pieces on the chessboard. There are many moves from each state (unless there are
only a few pieces left) which means each node will have many branches and each of those branches will go to a node with many branches
of its own. This tree grows in size very quickly as you start to check it at greater depths. If you're interested the number of possible moves, check [this](https://www.chess.com/chessopedia/view/mathematics-and-chess)
out.
